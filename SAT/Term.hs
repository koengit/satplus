Module      : SAT.Term
Description : Representing sums of products of literals

This module can be used to implement so-called pseudo-boolean constraints.
These are constraints of the form:

@
a1 * x1 + ... + ak * xk <= c
@

where @a1@..@an@ and @c@ are integer constants, and @x1@..@xk@ are SAT literals.

To add such a constraint, simply create two terms:

@
lhs = fromList [(a1,x1),..,(ak,xk)]
rhs = number c
@

and use any of the comparison constraints in the 'Order' type class, for
example:

@
lessThanEqual s lhs rhs
@

When adding a constraint, terms are normalized as much as possible (so the
user does not have to worry about this). When creating terms, almost no
normalization happens.
